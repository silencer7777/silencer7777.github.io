          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello. My name is Brett Cope.</p>
          <p>I am a 28 year old male who was born in 1996 in Apple Valley, CA.</p>
          <p>I grew up loving nature and being active.</p>
          <p>At the age of 10, I hopped on a skateboard for the first time and immediately fell in love with the sport.</p>
          <p>As I grew older, I explored a variety of different hobbies, from skateboarding to playing sports and eventually picked up painting as a recent hobby.</p>
          <p>Every hobby I commit myself to helps me self-reflect and connect with individuals.</p>
          <p>I love and care for people, and I try to put others first before myself.</p>
