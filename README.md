<h1>Welcome to Brett Cope's Autobiography</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my autobiography.My name is Brett Cope. I am a 28 year old, male, who was born in 1996. My birthplace is Apple Valley,CA. I grew up loving nature and exploring the outdoors. At the early age of 10, I hope on a skateboard for the first time ever 
and immediately fell in love with it. As I grew older, I explored different kind of hobbies. From skateboarding to playing sports and eventually picked up painting. Every hobby I commit myself to, helps me self reflect
and helps me connect with people. I love and care for people and I try putting others first before myself. I am currently in a dicipleship program called Emmaus, located here in Compton,CA. Since being here, I have been able to maintain sobriety, get closer to God
and become a stronger,more confident,indivdual. I am grateful and have gained some form of peace. I don't plan for my journey to come to a hault intil my last breathe.</p>
