  Hello. My name is Brett Cope. I am a 28 year old, male, who was born in 1996. 
   My birthplace is Apple Valley,CA. I grew up loving nature and always enjoy exploring the outdoors. 
   At the early age of 10, I hopped on a skateboard for the first time and 
   immediately fell in love with the sport. As I grew older, I explored a variety of diffrent hobbies. 
   From skateboarding to playing sports and eventually picked up painting as a recent hobby. 
   Every hobby I commit myself to, helps me self reflect
and helps me connect with people. I love and care for people and I try putting others first before myself. 
   I am currently in a dicipleship program called Emmaus, located here in Compton,CA. Since being here, I have been maintaining my sobriety, gotten closer to God
and have become a stronger,more confident,indivdual. 
   I can't begin to express how grateful I am for the URM and all the people who have supported me but I give my biggest thanks to all who have helped. 
   I am grateful and have gained some form of peace so I don't plan to stop making progress and will continue to look forward.</p>
