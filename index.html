          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>I am currently in a discipleship program called Emmaus, located in Compton, CA.</p>
          <p>Since being here, I have maintained my sobriety, gotten closer to God and I have become a stronger, more confident individual.</p>
          <p>I can't begin to express how grateful I am for the URM and all the people who have supported me. My biggest thanks go to all who have helped.</p>
          <p>I have also gained some form of peace so I don't plan to stop making progress and will continue to move forward.</p>
