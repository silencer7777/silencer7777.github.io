          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hello. My name is Brett Cope.</p>
          <p>I am a 28 year old male, born in 1996 in Apple Valley, CA.</p>
          <p>I grew up loving nature and I always try my best to stay active.</p>
          <p>At the age of 10, I hopped on a skateboard for the first time and immediately fell in love with the sport.</p>
          <p>As I grew older, I explored a variety of different hobbies, from skateboarding to playing sports and eventually picked up painting as a recent hobby.</p>
          <p>Every hobby I commit myself to helps me self-reflect and connect with people.</p>
          <p>I love and care for people and I try to put others first before myself. Being a family man is valuable for me and I cherish every relationship in my life.
             Having a strong will to learn and to progress is shown through my character and is affirmed through what others say about me.</p>
