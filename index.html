    <p>Hello. My name is Brett Cope. I am a 28-year-old male, born in 1996 in Apple Valley, CA. I grew up loving nature and always enjoy exploring the outdoors. At the age of 10, I hopped on a skateboard for the first time and immediately fell in love with the sport.</p>

    <p>As I grew older, I explored a variety of different hobbies, from skateboarding to playing sports, and eventually picked up painting as a recent hobby. Every hobby I commit to helps me self-reflect and connect with people. I love and care for people and try putting others first before myself.</p>

    <p>I am currently in a discipleship program called Emmaus, located in Compton, CA. Since being here, I have maintained my sobriety, gotten closer to God, and become a stronger, more confident individual. I can't begin to express how grateful I am for the URM and all the people who have supported me. My biggest thanks go to all who have helped. I am grateful and have gained some form of peace, so I don't plan to stop making progress and will continue to look forward.</p>
