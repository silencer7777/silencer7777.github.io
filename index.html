  Hello. My name is Brett Cope. I am a 28 year old, male, who was born in 1996. My birthplace is Apple Valley,CA. I grew up loving nature and exploring the outdoors. At the early age of 10, I hopped on a skateboard for the first time 
and immediately fell in love with it. As I grew older, I explored a variety of diffrent hobbies. From skateboarding to playing sports and eventually picked up painting. Every hobby I commit myself to, helps me self reflect
and helps me connect with people. I love and care for people and I try putting others first before myself. I am currently in a dicipleship program called Emmaus, located here in Compton,CA. Since being here, I have been maintaining my sobriety, gotten closer to God
and have become a stronger,more confident,indivdual. I am grateful and have gained some form of peace and I don't plan for my journey to come to a hault until my last breathe breathe breathe.</p>
